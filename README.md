## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I found Frontend Mentor while searching for additional resources and challenges as I work through The Odin Project (TOP). The Odin Project has been an amazing resource for learning Web Deb, but I find that practicing as much as possible will be a key component to my success. Queue Frontend Mentor! I look forward to completing more exercises in sequential order from easiest to hardest.

Having moved onto the javascript exercises via TOP, I found that I was quickly losing some of the basics when it comes to HTML/CSS. This project was a nice refresher and return to the material I learned from the website project in TOP. This exercise reinforced the following for me:

- Linking fonts from Google Fonts both in the HTML and CSS file
- Establishing a solid file structure and linking to the .css
- Flexbox concepts and assigning classes when appropriate

### Continued development

While I have a good grasp on Flexbox, I still feel I have more to learn. I'm often guessing at what the flex property might do or I still scratch my head with the flex property itself - including flex-basis. I look forward to practicing more CSS exercises to further reinforce my current knowledge.

### Useful resources

- [HTML Cheatsheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/) - A great resource to quickly look up HTML properties, structures, tags, etc.
- [FLEX: A visual cheatsheet](https://flexbox.malven.co/) - This is an amazing resource to quickly reference all the different properties of the flexbox system.
